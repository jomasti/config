# Sourced by .bashrc and .zshrc (interactive shells)
# Depends on shell/vars (which should have been loaded into env by login shell)
#
# Stuff here is used by .zshrc and .bashrc (so unlike vars, this is updated on
# every TTY and not loaded once in env/profile).
#
# Regarding tmux:
# Since my tmux shells are not login shells the path needs to be rebuilt.
# shell/vars on the other hand just get inherited.
